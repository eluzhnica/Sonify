Peanut-Butter
Sandwich
Where
The
Sidewalk
Ends
I
ll
sing
you
a
poem
of
a
silly
young
king
Who
played
with
the
world
at
the
end
of
a
string
But
he
only
loved
one
single
thing—
And
that
was
just
a
peanut-butter
sandwich
His
scepter
and
his
royal
gowns
His
regal
throne
and
golden
crowns
Were
brown
and
sticky
from
the
mounds
And
drippings
from
each
peanut-butter
sandwich
His
subjects
all
were
silly
fools
For
he
had
passed
a
royal
rule
That
all
that
they
could
learn
in
school
Was
how
to
make
a
peanut-butter
sandwich
He
would
not
eat
his
sovereign
steak
He
scorned
his
soup
and
kingly
cake
And
told
his
courtly
cook
to
bake
An
extra-sticky
peanut-butter
sandwich
And
then
one
day
he
took
a
bit
And
started
chewing
with
delight
But
found
his
mouth
was
stuck
quite
tight
From
that
last
bite
of
peanut-butter
sandwich
His
brother
pulled
his
sister
pried
The
wizard
pushed
his
mother
cried
"My
boy
s
committed
suicide
From
eating
his
last
peanut-butter
sandwich!"
The
dentist
came
and
the
royal
doc
The
royal
plumber
banged
and
knocked
But
still
those
jaws
stayed
tightly
locked
Oh
darn
that
sticky
peanut-butter
sandwich!
The
carpenter
he
tried
with
pliers
The
telephone
man
tried
with
wires
The
firemen
they
tried
with
fire
But
couldn
t
melt
that
peanut-butter
sandwich
With
ropes
and
pulleys
drills
and
coil
With
steam
and
lubricating
oil—
For
twenty
years
of
tears
and
toil—
They
fought
that
awful
peanut-butter
sandwich
Then
all
his
royal
subjects
came
They
hooked
his
jaws
with
grapplin
chains
And
pulled
both
ways
with
might
and
main
Against
that
stubborn
peanut-butter
sandwich
Each
man
and
woman
girl
and
boy
Put
down
their
ploughs
and
pots
and
toys
And
pulled
until
kerack!
Oh
joy—
They
broke
right
through
that
peanut-butter
sandwhcih
A
puff
of
dust
a
screech
a
squeak—
The
king
s
jaw
opened
with
a
creak
And
then
in
voice
so
faint
and
weak—
The
first
words
that
they
heard
him
speak
Were
"How
about
a
peanut-butter
sandwich?"
